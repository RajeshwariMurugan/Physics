### **Folder Structure**  

1. **Certificates**  
   - Contains all the certificates from webinars, workshops, and quiz exams I participated in during my academic years.  
   - Each certificate is labeled clearly for easy navigation.  

2. **Undergraduate (UG) Projects**  
   - **Title**: *Graphical Representations of Physics Practical Using C Program and Visual Basic*  
     - This project explores the visualization of physics experimental data using programming tools.  
     - Tools Used:  
       - **C Programming**: For data computation and representation.  
       - **Visual Basic**: For user-friendly graphical interfaces.  
     - Files include:         
       - Documentation detailing the project objectives, methodology, and outcomes.  

3. **Postgraduate (PG) Projects**  
   - **Title**: *Photoluminescence (PL) Characterization of Pure ZnO and Mg-Doped ZnO Thin Films by SILAR Method*  
     - This project focuses on the synthesis and photoluminescence analysis of ZnO and Mg-doped ZnO thin films.  
     - Highlights:  
       - Use of the SILAR (Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction) method for thin-film fabrication.  
       - Detailed analysis of PL properties to understand material behavior.  
     - Files include:  
       - Research paper or thesis.  
       - Experimental data and analysis results.  
       - Supporting images and documentation.
